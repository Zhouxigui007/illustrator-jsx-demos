### Version 
1.0.0

### About

This script is a simple demo of an Adobe Illustrator ExtendScript written using the Module pattern.
The script doesn't really do anything except demonstrate a rough outline for how to build clean,
readable and well-organized scripts for Adobe Illustrator. Others, no doubt, have different
ideas but I am always trying to make my code cleaner, better organized, more reusable, and
more extensible.

### Usage

1. Place this script in Applications > Adobe Illustrator > Presets > en_US > Scripts
2. Restart Adobe Illustrator to activate the script
3. The script will be available under menu File > Scripts > My Module

### Road Map

1. JSX -> NodeJS Proof-of-concept
2. JSX -> NodeJS REST implementation
3. Create a re-usable library of common JSX elements & tools
